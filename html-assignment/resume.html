            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi I'm Rens! I've been working at Sogeti as a Frontend Developer since January. Before joining the team,
                I studied Biology and also shortly worked in that branche. During my studies I was always very
                interested in visualising the things I was learning, like unique or big data sets and thinking about how
                to present complex information in a way that makes it easy to understand. Even though biology is a very
                interesting field of study, I never felt like I could really do the things that I wanted to do. I have
                an insatiable apppite for creativity and problem solving. To satisfy this need, I did some freelance
                graphic design next to my current job and picked up frontend development as a hobby. I soon realised
                that frontend development was the perfect combination of activities that I liked to be occupied with.
                That's why I decided to make a career switch and fully focus on becomming a good developer.

                In my spare time I like to go bouldering, mostly indoors but If I get the chance outdoors in and around
                Europe. I love playing tactical boardgames, play guitar here and there and am busy setting up a NFT
                project that features 3D puzzle NFTs.
